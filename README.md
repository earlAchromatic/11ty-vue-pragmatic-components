# Pragmatic Vue Components 🔌

## Use Vue Components to author HTML/nunjucks/liquid layouts in 11ty SSG

I have wanted to use Vue components directly in my markup for a while. This is easily done by exporting Vue Components as Native Web Components (.ce.vue) but then you deal with other issues... some of these are dealt with in lit's 11ty plugin setup..

Now, we have a fully capable partial hydration setup and Fully functional vue components in SFC format that I can simply write as if they were HTML while I am composing layouts and pages.

The best part is, I can use slotting to write embedded  inside . I can even use other components inside my components just by adding the Vue elements.
