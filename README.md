# Pragmatic Vue Components ðŸ”Œ

## Use Vue Components to author HTML/nunjucks/liquid layouts in 11ty SSG

I have wanted to use Vue components directly in my markup for a while. This is easily done by exporting Vue Components as Native Web Components (.ce.vue) but then you deal with other issues... some of these are dealt with in lit's 11ty plugin setup..

I like the idea of just writing the components in and having an 11ty plugin add the vue scripts as necessary. Some of these can get prerendered and not hydrated, some can get hydrated and you can just use async components and determine rules for when the component is fetched.

Now, we have a fully capable partial hydration setup and Fully functional vue components in SFC format that I can simply write as if they were HTML while I am composing layouts and pages.

The best part is, I can use slotting to write embedded markup inside components. I can even use other components inside my components just by adding the Vue elements.

Cons:

its a vue only solution
ships with vue runtime compiler
have to register components manually (how can I automate this)

Pros:

its a vue only solution
focuses on 1 framework
focuses on authorability (no shortcodes)
no shortcodes necessary for slotting

slots first approach - deeply nested slots are easily accomplished. This is important for templating.
props passing capable
SSR + partial hydr ready
simple script injection for render modes??? (separate plugin)
Just an 11ty plugin, not a whole wrapper around 11ty.
uses Vue async components for partial hydration on a per component's logic basis
leverages official 11ty maintained plugins
no custom elements required

## Feature list to build

- props seeker via attr
- 11ty data props builder/helper functions (see nunjucks loops to build data object in jacobmilhorn.com proj)
- multiple component loop (for the .componetn() func)
- recursive component recognition in child template (see above item, they are the same thing)
- automatic component registration based on whats in the `components` folder
- automatic node modules aliasing in vite config
- proper 11ty plugin format in an `.eleventy.js`
